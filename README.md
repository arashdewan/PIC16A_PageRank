# PageRank
PageRank works by allowing a "random surfer" to move around webpages by following links. Each time the surfer lands on a page, it then looks for all the links on that page. It then picks one at random and follows it, thereby arriving at the next page, where the process repeats. Because the surfer moves between linked pages, PageRank expresses an intuitive idea: important pages are linked to other important pages.

Using the script of the Hamilton play, by obtaining data on who talks about whom in each of the show's songs. When character A mentions character B, you can think of this as a link from A to B, suggesting that B might be important.
